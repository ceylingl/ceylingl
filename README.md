## 🌷 A little bit about me
I’m someone who loves to grow, explore, and keep learning.

- 🌍 Life brought me to **California** through an exchange program, and I spent time as a nanny—an experience that taught me patience, adaptability, and how to connect with people from different backgrounds.  
- 👶 I discovered something new that made my heart race: **Cybersecurity**.  
- 🔐 Now I’m building my path as a **SOC Analyst**, combining my love for systems, problem-solving, and protecting what matters.  

## 🌸 Outside of work
