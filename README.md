# 👋 Hey, I’m Ceylin! <br/> [SOC Analyst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceylin-guclu)</a>

## 🌷 A little bit about me
I’m someone who loves to grow, explore, and keep learning.  
- 🎓 I studied **Industrial Engineering** in Turkey.  
- 🏭 I started my career as a **Planning & Purchasing Engineer**, where I learned how much I enjoy solving problems and improving systems.  
- 🌍 Life brought me to **California** through an exchange program, and I spent time as a nanny—an experience that taught me patience, adaptability, and how to connect with people from different backgrounds.  
- 👶 I discovered something new that made my heart race: **Cybersecurity**.  
- 🔐 Now I’m building my path as a **SOC Analyst**, combining my love for systems, problem-solving, and protecting what matters.  

## 🌸 Outside of work
- 🏃‍♀️ I enjoy running and challenging myself with new goals.  
- ☕ Coffee lover—always looking for cozy cafés.  
- ✈️ Dreamer of travels, new cultures, and stories.
